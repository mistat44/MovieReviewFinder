# A ReactJS Single Page Application (SPA) that uses TMDb API to find movie reviews and display movie info dynamically.

This application is built to practice ReactJS skills with the use of an external API. It involves conditional rendering, using components with state and using modern react practices such as arrow functions (instead of binding "this" for every method). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
